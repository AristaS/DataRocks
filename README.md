# DataRocks - Google Street View Image Character Recognition With Julia
Final Project Proposal for ORIE 4741

The project proposal should be no more than 1 page, written in LaTeX or markdown, and posted on your project repository with the filename “project_proposal”. (The file extension should be either .tex + .pdf, or just .md.) It should identify a question, and a data set that you'll use to answer the question. Justify why the problem is important, and why you think the data set will allow you to (begin to) answer the question.

Stylistically, the proposal should be written as though it were a memo to your manager (at whatever kind of enterprise might care about this question: either government, nonprofit, or industry). You should justify why it's worthwhile to this enterprise for you to work on the project for a few months, and why you think you're likely to succeed.

Our final project proposal is to use a dataset that we found on www.kaggle.com that has images from Google StreetView of characters. We intend to see if we can figure out which picture corresponds to which character, and in training a model to do so , see if we can use this generalized image classification method on other instances, like captcha. We could also extend this model to do help with computer vision problems, such as reading traffic signs, store names and other various things that may be useful.

RE: Project Proposal

  The DataRocks division is proud to introduce a proposal that will bring untold benefits to the company. We believe that by analyzing pictures taken from Google's StreetView (generously provided to us by Kaggle), we are able to create a classifier that is able to take images as an input and output text. This is a great opportunity that we should seize in order to get an edge on the market. By being able to answer the question of what a picture is saying, the company can take visual cues from pictures that they have seen. We can ...
  
  We plan on utlizing various techniques learned in class to make sense of the data. We can try to see if there are any patterns within the pixel values that corresponds to actual patterns in the image, or see if different clusters of pixels have a correlation with diffent similar features of an image. Furthermore, the data that we obtain from the datasets that Kaggle provides is theoretically already clean (there should be no missing pixels), and will help smoothen the process of finding a way of classifying these images.
  
  We also plan on researching techniques that are commonly used amongst other data specialists and seeing whether or not we can incorporate them in order to better train our model. Better yet, we may even be able to draw inspiration from different models currently used and come up with a new technique in our classifier.
  
  We hope to work on this project for the rest of the year and be able to commit to create a classifier. As such, at the end of the time, we will deliver a report detailing our results, problems and solutions.
