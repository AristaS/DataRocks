# DataRocks - Google Street View Image Character Recognition With Julia
Final Project Proposal for ORIE 4741

Our final project proposal is to use a dataset that we found on www.kaggle.com that has images from Google StreetView of characters. We intend to see if we can figure out which picture corresponds to which character, and in training a model to do so , see if we can use this generalized image classification method on other instances, like captcha. We could also extend this model to do help with computer vision problems, such as reading traffic signs, store names and other various things that may be useful.
