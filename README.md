# DataRocks - Google Street View Image Character Recognition With Julia
Final Project Proposal for ORIE 4741

The project proposal should be no more than 1 page, written in LaTeX or markdown, and posted on your project repository with the filename “project_proposal”. (The file extension should be either .tex + .pdf, or just .md.) It should identify a question, and a data set that you'll use to answer the question. Justify why the problem is important, and why you think the data set will allow you to (begin to) answer the question.

Stylistically, the proposal should be written as though it were a memo to your manager (at whatever kind of enterprise might care about this question: either government, nonprofit, or industry). You should justify why it's worthwhile to this enterprise for you to work on the project for a few months, and why you think you're likely to succeed.

Our final project proposal is to use a dataset that we found on www.kaggle.com that has images from Google StreetView of characters. We intend to see if we can figure out which picture corresponds to which character, and in training a model to do so , see if we can use this generalized image classification method on other instances, like captcha. We could also extend this model to do help with computer vision problems, such as reading traffic signs, store names and other various things that may be useful.
